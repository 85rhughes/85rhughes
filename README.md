- 👋 Hi, I’m @85rhughes#
- 👀 I’m interested in systems and making them better.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python, html, css, flask, R, ...a bunch of autodesk programs related to construction, and just about anything I find related to computer science, or science in general.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that improves the way we work or (how we communicate about the work we're doing), automates repetitive tasks, and/or anything that returns time back to the individual to improve work/life balance.
- 📫 How to reach me: I'll update this soon.
